# Android Clean Architecture and MVP

This sample project shows how to implement clean architecture (Or any other similar architecture)
to an Android project. In short with a clean architecture your code is splitted across various layers,
with the objective to separate the business logic code from the code of the UI, database, etc.

The core of the app (Entities and use cases layers) are implemented with a pure java project. This is
good because it forces your core code to not have any dependency with Android system. And if your core
code is not dependant from Android SDK, it will be following the dependency rule. In addition that will
be easier to unit test your code since to run the test will not require any Android instrumentation
framework.

The UI is implemented using MVP (Model View Presenter). The Presenter is implemented using a normal Java
class that doesnâ€™t extend any Android framework classe (Activity, Fragment, View, etc). The only special
thing that have these Presenter classes, are that they implement an interface called Presenter. The View
are simply a typical Android UI class (Activity, Fragment or View) that implements an interface called
Display. Here we chose Display instead of View to avoid name clashing with Android View classes.

The best part comes on how this implementation supports configuration changes. This project introduces
the PresenterHolder, that it will be in charge of manage all the Presenter instances used inside an
Activity context. The trick is to implement this PresenterHolder with a Fragment that have the retain
instance flag set to true (setRetainInstance). With this flag set to true, the PresenterHolder Fragment
will survive to any configuration change, and by extension all the Presenters that are managed by
this holder.

## Features of this sample

* Allows the user to search for the current weather of any city of the world.
* Shows the weather forecast of a city for the next 3 days.
* Uses OpenWeatherMap APIs to query the data.
* Implements clean architecture.
* Separated Java only project for business logic code.
* MVP implementation that is configuration changes friendly (Supports orientation changes).
* Use of Repository pattern to access server APIs.
